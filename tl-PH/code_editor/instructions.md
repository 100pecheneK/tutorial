Karamihan sa mga gumagamit ng Python na wikang pamprograma ay pumipili ng mga kumplikado ngunit makapangyarihang IDEs (tinatawag na Integrated Development Environments), katulad ng PyCharm. Ngunit bilang baguhan sa larangang ito, nirerekomenda namin na magsimula ka muna sa payak at magaan na mga pamamaraan at kagamitan.

Ang aming mga mungkahi ay nasa ibaba, pero huwag mag-atubiling magtanong sa iyong coach kung ano ang iyong mga kagustuhan - mas madaling makakuha ng tulong mula sa kanila.

## Why are we installing a code editor?

You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something like Word or Notepad.

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favorite tools. :)
