本当にたくさんのエディタがありますが、どれを使うかは、結局は、ほとんど個人の好みの問題です。 ほとんどのPythonプログラマは、PyCharmなど、複雑ですが非常に強力なIDE（統合開発環境）というものを使っています。 しかし、初心者にとってはIDEはそれほど適していないかもしれないので、同じくらい強力で、もっとシンプルなものをオススメします。

オススメのエディタは下記に挙げますが、気軽にコーチに質問して好みや特徴ををきいてみてください。

## Visual Studio Code

## Why are we installing a code editor?

You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something like Word or Notepad.

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favorite tools. :)
