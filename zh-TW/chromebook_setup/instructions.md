如果您不是使用 Chromebook 的話，您可以 [跳過這個章節](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#install-python)。 如果是的話，您的安裝過程將會有些許的不同。 您可以忽略其餘的安裝說明。

### Cloud IDE (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE, AWS Cloud9)

Cloud 9 這工具會提供一個程式碼編輯器(code editor)，並讓你存取一台位於網路上的電腦，使你可以透過它安裝、撰寫、以及執行軟體。 在這個教程指南中，Cloud 9 將能當作您的*本機電腦*來執行。 您仍將在終端機介面中執行指令，跟同學使用在 OS X、Ubuntu、或是 Windows 一樣，但是您的終端機是連接到一個由 Cloud 9 為您設定在其他地方的主機。 這是為cloud IDEs (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE, AWS Cloud9)設計的指南 You can choose one of the cloud IDEs, and follow the instruction of the cloud IDE.

#### PaizaCloud Cloud IDE

1. 到[PaizaCloud Cloud IDE](https://paiza.cloud/)
2. 建立帳戶
3. 點擊*新伺服器*和選擇Django應用程式
4. Click Terminal button(on the left side of the window)

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, buttons at the left. Click "Terminal" button to open terminal window with prompt like this:

{% filename %}Terminal{% endfilename %}

    $
    

The terminal on the PaizaCloud Cloud IDE is prepared for your instructions. You can resize or maximize that window to make it a bit bigger.

#### AWS Cloud9

Currently Cloud 9 requires you to sign up with AWS and enter credit card information.

1. Install Cloud 9 from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud9/nbdmccoknlfggadpfkmcpnamfnbkmkcp)
2. Go to [c9.io](https://c9.io) and click *Get started with AWS Cloud9*
3. Sign up for an AWS account (requires credit card information, but you can use it for free)
4. In the AWS Dashboard, enter *Cloud9* in the search bar and click it
5. In the Cloud 9 dashboard, click *Create environment*
6. Name it *django-girls*
7. While configuring settings, select *Create a new instance for environment (EC2)* for "Environment Type" and the *t2.micro* "Instance type" (it should say "Free-tier eligible."). The default cost-saving setting is fine and you can keep the other defaults.
8. Click *Next step*
9. Click *Create environment*

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, a big main window with some text, and a small window at the bottom that looks something like this:

{% filename %}bash{% endfilename %}

    yourusername:~/workspace $
    

This bottom area is your terminal. You can use the terminal to send instructions to the remote Cloud 9 computer. You can resize that window to make it a bit bigger.

### 虛擬環境 [Virtual Environment]

A virtual environment (also called a virtualenv) is like a private box we can stuff useful computer code into for a project we're working on. We use them to keep the various bits of code we want for our various projects separate so things don't get mixed up between projects.

Run:

{% filename %}Cloud 9{% endfilename %}

    mkdir djangogirls
    cd djangogirls
    python3.6 -mvenv myvenv
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    pip install django~={{ book.django_version }}
    

(note that on the last line we use a tilde followed by an equal sign: `~=`).

### GitHub

Make a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

### PythonAnywhere

The Django Girls tutorial includes a section on what is called Deployment, which is the process of taking the code that powers your new web application and moving it to a publicly accessible computer (called a server) so other people can see your work.

This part is a little odd when doing the tutorial on a Chromebook since we're already using a computer that is on the Internet (as opposed to, say, a laptop). However, it's still useful, as we can think of our Cloud 9 workspace as a place for our "in progress" work and Python Anywhere as a place to show off our stuff as it becomes more complete.

Thus, sign up for a new Python Anywhere account at [www.pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
