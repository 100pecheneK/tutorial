## Xin chào mừng

Chào mừng bạn đã đến với Django Girls Tutorial! Chúng tôi rất hạnh phúc khi thấy bạn ở đây :) Trong bài hướng dẫn này, chúng tôi sẽ đồng hành cùng bạn trên chuyến đi tìm hiểu về công nghệ đằng sau các website, đem lại cho bạn từng mảnh ghép để tạo nên một website hoàn chỉnh.

Giống nhưng những điều chưa biết khác, đây sẽ là một chuyến phiêu lưu - nhưng đừng lo lắng nhé, bởi vì bạn đã can đảm để ở đây, vậy nên bạn sẽ chinh phục được thôi :)

## Giới thiệu

Bạn đã bao giờ từng cảm thấy rằng thế giới đang càng ngày càng phát triển về công nghệ, người ta nói rất nhiều về công nghệ, mà bạn thấy mình không thể (hoặc chưa) tham gia vào không? Have you ever wondered how to create a website but have never had enough motivation to start? Have you ever thought that the software world is too complicated for you to even try doing something on your own?

Well, we have good news for you! Programming is not as hard as it seems and we want to show you how fun it can be.

This tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer. If you want to be good at it, you need months or even years of learning and practice. But we want to show you that programming or creating websites is not as complicated as it seems. We will try to explain different bits and pieces as well as we can, so you will not feel intimidated by technology.

We hope that we'll be able to make you love technology as much as we do!

## What will you learn during the tutorial?

Once you've finished the tutorial, you will have a small working web application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!

It will (more or less) look like this:

> If you work with the tutorial on your own and don't have a coach who will help you in case of any problem, we have a chat system for you: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial.svg)](https://gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial). We asked our coaches and previous attendees to be there from time to time and help others with the tutorial! Don't be afraid to ask your question there!

OK, [let's start at the beginning…](./how_the_internet_works/README.md)

## Following the tutorial at home

It is amazing to take part in a Django Girls workshop, but we are aware that it is not always possible to attend one. This is why we encourage you to try following this tutorial at home. For readers at home, we are currently preparing videos that will make it easier to follow the tutorial on your own. It is still a work in progress, but more and more things will be covered soon at the [Coding is for girls](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hNd2uW8jTR5K3KBzRuG2A/feed) YouTube channel.

In every chapter already covered, there is a link that points to the correct video.
