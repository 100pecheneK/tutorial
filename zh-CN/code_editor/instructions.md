有很多不同的编辑器，通常根据个人偏好选择。 大部分 Python程序员使用像 PyCharm这样复杂但是功能强大的IDE (集成开发环境)。 然而，这可能不太适合初学者。我们建议使用同样强大但是更为简单的编辑器。

下面是我们的建议，不过你可以随时询问你的教练有什么推荐 - 向他们寻求帮助会更简单些。

## Why are we installing a code editor?

You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something like Word or Notepad.

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favorite tools. :)
