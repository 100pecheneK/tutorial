## Welcome

欢迎来到Django Girls教程！ We are happy to see you here :) In this tutorial, we will take you on a journey under the hood of web technologies, offering you a glimpse of all the bits and pieces that need to come together to make the web work as we know it.

As with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be just fine :)

## 介绍

Have you ever felt that the world is more and more about technology to which you cannot (yet) relate? 你有没有想去做一个网站，但是却从未有过足够的动力去开始吗? 你有没有想过软件世界太过复杂，即使你想做一些属于自己的东西？

好的，我们跟你讲一个好消息！编程没有看上去那么复杂，我们将给你展示它是多么的有趣。

This tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer. 如果你想变得擅长于此，你需要数月乃至数年的时间去学习和练习。 但是我们想展示给你编程和创建网站没有看起来那么复杂。 我们试着用深入浅出的方法解释，所以你不会觉得被技术吓到。

我们希望我们可以让你变得更爱技术，像我们一样！

## 在本教程里你会学到什么？

Once you've finished the tutorial, you will have a small working web application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!

它将（或多或少）看起来像这个样子：

> If you work with the tutorial on your own and don't have a coach who will help you in case of any problem, we have a chat system for you: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial.svg)](https://gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial). 我们要求我们的教练以及之前的参与者时不时到那里去，帮助其他人参与本教程！ 不要担心什么，尽管大胆地提问吧！

OK, [let's start at the beginning…](./how_the_internet_works/README.md)

## Following the tutorial at home

It is amazing to take part in a Django Girls workshop, but we are aware that it is not always possible to attend one. This is why we encourage you to try following this tutorial at home. For readers at home, we are currently preparing videos that will make it easier to follow the tutorial on your own. It is still a work in progress, but more and more things will be covered soon at the [Coding is for girls](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hNd2uW8jTR5K3KBzRuG2A/feed) YouTube channel.

In every chapter already covered, there is a link that points to the correct video.
